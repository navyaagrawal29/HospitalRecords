# HospitalRecords
Management of patient databases in hospitals can be designed as menu-driven and using files. The system should keep track of the records of patients and the details such as their name, age, ward number, their medical issue.
The system should be able to view, edit, search or delete an already existing record. It should also be able to take in new entries.
